* docs are not that extensive
* api docs are useful
* learn to understand what all these things in api docs mean
* old blog posts/stackoverflow answers don't help much
* most searches for errors or "how to do things" end up at the github issue tracker
* very restricted compared to ruby
* rustdoc generates great docs (if you write them)
* explicit types make a lot of the stuff much clearer.
* compiler warnings/error messages are mostly really useful (clang-style)
* in-built testing per source file is a great way to keep it all together
* still no idea how to properly do modules, seperate logic into files, ...
* first try with structs per element didn't work out.
* verbose syntax (which isn't bad per say), but not "boilerplate"
* some not-so-good syntax elements (`'` as lifetime indicator)
* [rust.vim](https://github.com/wting/rust.vim) does everything right from the start (autowrapping doc lines, correct doc syntax)
* macros are a nice addition
* pattern matching simplifies some stuff (better use pattern matching than an additional if clause)
* coming from mostly C and Ruby all these mutable/immutable is not that easy to grasp. My code might be inefficient in that regard
